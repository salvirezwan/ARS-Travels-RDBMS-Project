# ARS-Travels-RDBMS-Project

This is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) Project that allows users to book hotels and flights through a travel agency. I collaborated with my classmates Abeer and Rafin for this project. It is a web-based application. Customers can book according to their preferences after registration. Admin has the privilege of adding, modifying, and deleting services in the database. You can just download the project and run it on Visual Studio Code or any other suitable IDE. I have created the tables in MySQL using Xampp.
